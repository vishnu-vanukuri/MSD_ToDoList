# 📋 Basic To-Do List App (HTML & CSS)

A basic prototype of a To-Do List App built only using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
Currently, it’s just the **UI structure** — no JavaScript functionality yet.  
This is the starting point for future development.

## ✨ Features (UI Only)
- 🧼 **Clean and simple layout**
- 🎨 Built with pure HTML & CSS
- 📱 Basic responsive styling (limited)
- 🚪 No signup — just a static prototype

## 📂 Project Structure
```

├── index.html   # Main HTML file
├── index.css    # Stylesheet
└── todo-list.jpg # Header image


## 🚀 How to View
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-app.git
````

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

* Add JavaScript functionality to add, edit, and remove tasks
* Improve responsiveness for mobile devices
* Store tasks locally (localStorage)
